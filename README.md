# Guesser Game

## Introduction
The Guesser Game is a simple Java-based number guessing game where a Guesser selects a number, and three players attempt to guess it. The Umpire then determines the winner based on the closest match to the Guesser's number. This project demonstrates fundamental Java concepts, including classes, objects, user input handling, and basic conditional logic.
